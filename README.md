# Relay Module with Arduino Nano

#### Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to control a relay module with an Arduino Nano. A relay module is an electrically operated switch that allows low-power circuits to control high-power devices, such as lights, motors, or appliances. This example toggles the relay state at regular intervals and displays its status on the serial monitor.

#### Components Needed

- **Arduino Nano**
- **Relay Module**
- **Jumper Wires**

#### Block diagram


#### Circuit Setup

1. **Connect Relay Module to Arduino Nano:**
   - **Control Pin:** Connect to digital pin 7 on Arduino Nano.
   - **VCC:** Connect to 5V on Arduino Nano.
   - **GND:** Connect to GND on Arduino Nano.

#### Instructions

1. **Circuit Setup:**
   - Connect the relay module to the Arduino Nano as described in the circuit setup section.

2. **Code Upload:**
   - Open the Arduino IDE and create a new sketch.
   - Copy and paste the provided Arduino code into the sketch.

3. **Testing:**
   - Upload the code to the Arduino Nano.
   - Open the serial monitor with a baud rate of 9600.
   - Observe the serial monitor output. It will display the current state of the relay module (ON or OFF) as it toggles every second.

#### Applications

- **Home Automation:** Use for controlling appliances or devices remotely via Arduino Nano.
- **Industrial Automation:** Implement in industrial applications for controlling high-power machinery.
- **Lighting Control:** Useful for switching lights on or off based on sensor inputs or programmed logic.

#### Notes

- Ensure the relay module is correctly connected to the Arduino Nano and powered.
- Adjust the delay in the code to change the interval between relay state toggles.
- Use appropriate precautions when dealing with high-voltage devices connected to the relay module.
